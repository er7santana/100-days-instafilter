# Instafilter

In this project we’re going to build an app that lets the user import photos from their library, then modify them using various image effects. We’ll cover a number of new techniques, but at the center of it all are one useful app development skill – using Apple’s Core Image framework – and one important SwiftUI skill – integrating with UIKit. There are other things too, but those two are the big takeaways.

## Features

- How property wrappers become structs
- Responding to state changes using onChange()
- Showing multiple options with confirmationDialog()
- Integrating Core Image with SwiftUI
- Showing empty states with ContentUnavailableView
- Loading photos from the user's photo library
- How to let the user share content with ShareLink
- How to ask the user to leave an App Store review
